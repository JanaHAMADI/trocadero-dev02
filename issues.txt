I) ng new <project> : impossible to generate a working project, indicating several version issues in node modules
Seems like npm and cli versions incompatibility

- have tried: rebooting pc, changing jasmine version in package.json, regenerating project while stopping 
	WindowsDefender realtime protection
- trying to run 'npm install -g @angular/cli@latest' throwing a permission error

SOLUTION: 
-deleting node.js
-install the node version manager (nvm) for windows from here: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
-install node with nvm: 'nvm install v16.13.1' in admin mode
-run 'nvm use 16.13.1' to use this version
-update cli: 'npm install -g @angular/cli@latest' successfull

-run 'ng new <app>' in your project workspace, packages installed successfully
-to test: in your project folder, run 'ng serve'
